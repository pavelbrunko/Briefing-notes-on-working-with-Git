This is a breafing notes about main Git and GitHub commands. You can use it when you forget some of them.
Let's start from some basic bash commands, which can help you to work with your machine throught the terminal.
- Check where are you now on your machine:
```bash
$ pwd
```
- Change the directory:
```bash
$ cd 'new_path'
```
- Make a folder:
```bash
$ mkdir 'folder_name'
```
- Make a .txt file:
```bash
$ touch 'file_name.txt'
```
- Remove file:
```bash
$ rm 'file_name'
```
- Remove folder:
```bash
$ rm -rf 'folder_name'
```
---
Now we are ready to do some Git things
## Making new repository
- Initialize repository:
```bash
$ git init 'project_name'
```
- Download repository:
```bash
$ git clone 'url_of_the_project'
```
---
## State of your repository:
- List of uncommited files:
```bash
$ git status
```
- Changes, which still don't added to file's index:
```bash
$ git diff
```
- Changed in already added files:
```bash
$ git diff --cached
```
- All changes:
```bash
$ git diff HEAD
```
- Changes between two commits:
```bash
$ git diff hash1 hash2 
```
- Receive the dates of the changes and their authers:
```bash
$ git blame 'file_name'
```
- Receive a list of changes in file in certain commit:
```bash
$ git show hash:file 
```  
- List of commits:
```bash
git log
```
- Show the story of changes, including diffs:
```bash
git log -p 'file_or_folder_name'
```

## Connect remote and local repository
- Bind a remote repository to a local one:
``` bash
git remote add origin 'github_ssh_key'
```
- Check if the repositories are connected:
``` bash
git remote -v
```
---
## Work with branches
- A list of local branches:
```bash
$ git branch
```
- A list of all branches:
```bash
$ git branch -av
```
- Switch to the branch mybranch:
```bash
$ git checkout mybranch
```
- Craeate branch mybranch and switch to it:
```bash
$ git checkout -b mybranch 
```
- Delete branch mybranch:
```bash
$ git branch -d mybranch
```
- Merge branches a and b:
```bash
$ git chechout b && git merge a
```
- Create a tag for current commit:
```bash
$ git tag 'tag_name'
```
---
## Save changes
- Add file to an index:
```bash
$ git add 'file_name'
```
- Add all files in the folder:
```bash

```
- Commit added files to an index with message:
```bash
$ git commit -m 'your_message'
```
- Commit all files with the message:
```bash
$ git commit -am 'your_message'
```
- Delete changed file from the index, leaving changes in it:
```bash
$ git reset 'file_name'
```
- Cancel all changes in the folder and return to the last commit:
```bash
$ git reset --hard
```
---
## Update
- Download changes from the remote repository:
```bash
$ git fetch
```
- Download changes from the remote repository and merge them:
```bash
$ git pull
``` 
- Download changes from the remote repository and overlay not running commits on top of downloaded ones:
```bash
$ git pull --rebase
```
- Send local commits to remote repository:
```bash

## And the main ones!
